        I had recently re-read the birthday card you wrote me for my last birthday and you talked about how much strength you got from me. 
        I realized that in reality you are the one who gives me strength and so much more. 
        Seeing who you are and the commbination of poise and strength in which you bear everything for those you love makes me hope in the future to be so self-sacrificing.
        Through good times and bad, you have been the constant in my life that I have been so lucky to have. The yin to my yang, the peanut butter to my jelly, the aliyan to my aliyan -- you are my partner in crime.
        I know that in everything I do, that I can go out there and be bold because you'll be supporting me, be courageous because with you I have nothing to fear, be dilligent because I have you as an example, be 
        strong because you have gone through more, be enterprising because you taught yourself what you needed to know, and be loving because you have loved me so fully.
        \n
        I could write forever about what an amazing person you are, but if you want something to show you that just look to me and Govind. We are who we are because of you and all the kindness and love you show us consistantly.
